The aim was to give students an opportunity to see the creative process up close and to show how visual art and music can create a shared experience.

In 2023, I organized a live painting performance for schools in Pargas. Together with cellist Joanna Hanhikoski, we combined visual art and live music to create an inspiring atmosphere for the students and staff. The session offered a chance to experience art in real time and encouraged young audiences to engage with creativity in a new way.
