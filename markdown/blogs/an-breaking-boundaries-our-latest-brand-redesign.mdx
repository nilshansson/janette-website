Surrounded by nature, the audience experienced art and music coming together in an open-air setting. The event received very positive feedback and was appreciated for its relaxed atmosphere and the way it brought people closer to both nature and the arts.

In the summer of 2022, I performed a live painting session to works by Rebecca Clarke, in an outdoor location in the archipelago close to Pargas. The combination of live classical music and painting in a natural setting created a memorable experience for everyone who attended. The audience feedback was very encouraging and highlighted how the setting and performance complemented each other beautifully.
