This painting came together in a way that felt almost accidental. I was just exploring—trying out shapes, textures, and letting the process lead the way. Somewhere along the way, I found a style that felt new to me, something I hadn’t quite done before. It might look different from my other pieces, but that’s part of what made it exciting. It felt like I gave myself permission to just see what would happen, and that freedom stayed in the painting.
