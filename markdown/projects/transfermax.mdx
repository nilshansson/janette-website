This painting started out as one of those uncertain ones—where I didn’t really know where I was going. Usually, that leads to frustration and pieces I don’t finish or feel good about. I actually stopped working on it for a few days, unsure if there was anything worth continuing. But when I came back to it, I tried to let go of the pressure to make something great, and just focused on creating without expecting too much. That shift changed everything. I started to see something new—especially in how the blue and yellow began to interact in ways I hadn’t painted before. In the end, I felt like I truly succeeded with this piece—not because it’s perfect, but because I allowed it to become what it wanted to be.
