was really happy with this painting because it felt like I captured something I hadn’t painted before. There’s a strange mix in it—something a bit unsettling, but also soft and comforting. It feels almost like it’s reaching out gently, while holding something deeper underneath. To me, it’s both threatening and kind, like a quiet hug that doesn’t try to fix anything, just stays with you. That feeling stayed with me while I worked on it, and it’s why this piece stands out to me.
