This painting started with a few big red shapes. I wasn’t sure if they would stay or if I’d end up covering them completely—but they somehow set the tone. Everything else grew from them. As I kept working, a kind of strange, small world began to appear—almost like a soft hallucination. The shapes felt strong but playful at the same time, like they had their own personalities. The red and blue started to interact in unexpected ways, and I just followed along, letting the painting tell me where to go.
